# Google-Playstore-Case-Study

This project is a small case study aimed at learning data cleaning and visualization using Python, with a focus on the libraries `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.

## Overview

The Google Playstore Case Study involves cleaning a dataset and visualizing the data using various charts. This project covers essential skills in data preprocessing and data visualization, which are critical for any data analysis task.

## Objectives

- Learn and apply data cleaning techniques.
- Use `matplotlib` for creating various types of plots.
- Use `seaborn` for creating advanced visualizations.
- Understand the process of exploratory data analysis (EDA).

## Data Cleaning

Data cleaning steps include:
- Handling missing values.
- Converting data types.
- Removing or replacing invalid entries.
- Standardizing data formats.

## Data Visualization

Various charts and plots are created using `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to visualize the cleaned data:
- **Box plots**: To understand the distribution and outliers in numerical data.
- **Histograms**: To visualize the distribution of a single numerical variable.
- **Scatter plots**: To examine relationships between two numerical variables.
- **Bar charts**: To compare categorical data.

## Tools and Libraries

- **Python**: The main programming language used.
- **pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **matplotlib**: For basic plotting.
- **seaborn**: For advanced visualizations.

## Conclusion

This case study serves as a practical introduction to data cleaning and visualization using Python. By working through this project, you will gain hands-on experience with some of the essential tools and techniques used in data analysis.
